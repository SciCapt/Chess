Not a terribly practical chess game, don't get too excited. Meant as a personal project to combine skills of various displays (such as the MatLab heatmap used) and python functions inside of eachother.

The end goal of having a completed chess game is to then have a platform of which I can test various Chess AIs (that I wish to make) on. This is certainly a far future project, but is the goal nonetheless.

There are still many things I would like to update the code with. But for now it is in relativley working order. Besides for the ability to checkmate someone instantly, that is.

A few things to update the game with include:
- Adding all of the piece's moveset (currently just have the possible moves of     pawns given, nothing else, no checks, etc.)
- Polishing off the said move limits (adding En Passant, highlighting selected   peice, etc.)
- Selecting the team or choosing a random team for the player at the start   (currently always white team, this will be helpful for the Chess AI's down the     road).

Much to be done, all kind of impractical, but too much fun to not do.
